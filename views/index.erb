<h3>Logan Meets World?</h2>
<p>Welcome to my personal website dedicated to hosting my writing, code, and opinionatedness on the internet. I am a recent college grad living in Seattle. I love data and information and using them to make the world a better place for everyone. Here are some of the great things you can enjoy on this website:</p>

<h3>World Meets Logan?</h2>

<p>I am a student at a software school in Seattle, learning to code, learning to be an adult, learning to be a good person. I am passionate about data, code, accessibility, and Hamilton the musical. My views are constantly evolving and changing as I meet more of the world. I love meeting people and listening to them talk to me about what they are interested in.</p>
